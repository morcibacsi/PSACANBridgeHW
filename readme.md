# PSA CAN protocol bridge (hardware)

### What is it ?
This is the hardware needed for my [PSA CAN protocol bridge][psacanbridge] software.

The files were created with KiCad

The main branch contains only this readme file as the boards themselves are pretty much different and having a continuous history does not really make sense. 
So every revision has its own branch. They are in the state as I sent them to the manufacturing company.
